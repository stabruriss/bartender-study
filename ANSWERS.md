# Execution answers

Maintainers add one dated response for each question id, commit on
`simulation-pilot`, and push. The execution agent fetches and merges that branch
before acting. Neither silence nor a technical answer constitutes run approval.

No questions have been answered yet. Parameters are approved in the configuration;
execution protocol approval remains pending in `RUN_APPROVAL.json`. Application
conformance requires its separate `CONFORMANCE_APPROVAL.json`.
